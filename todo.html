<h1>TODO list for the Linux <em>man-pages</em> project</h1>

        There are many things that might or should be done in the future
        for <em>man-pages</em>.
        This page describes a few of them.
        Help with, or opinions about, these ideas is welcome.

<h2>Migrate <em>man-pages</em> into the kernel source tree (?)</h2>

    <p>
        This idea has been floated by a few people.
        There are some advantages:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            It might encourage kernel developers to work on 
            man pages by placing them in the same location as the kernel source code.
            <br>
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>
            Kernel source code patches changing the behavior of kernel-userland 
            interfaces could include patches to the corresponding
            man page text, and thus documentation patches could flow up the
            maintainer chain in the usual fashion.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        There are also some disadvantages:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The split between system calls and library functions is not 
            clear cut from the point of view of the userland programmer.
            Sometimes, glibc wrappers do some extra work before invoking
            the underlying system call.
            Currently, the section 2 pages document the behavior of the 
            glibc wrapper, which may be different from the underlying system call,
            and attempt (i.e., it's the goal, but not all pages do this well)
            to include NOTES that describe differences in the
            underlying system call.
            (For example, see the "C library/kernel ABI differences" in the
            <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages//man2/select.2.html#NOTES">NOTES
            section of <em>select(2)</em></a>.)
	    In addition, the man pages for system calls document
	    other user space details, such as header file requirements,
	    feature test macro requirements for glibc,
	    thread-safety (under the ATTRIBUTES section),
            <br>
            <br>
        </li>
            One way to address this would be to truly separate the system call and
            glibc wrapper information into two separate pages, one in Section 2,
            the other in Section 3.
            But this would require one of the following approaches,
            each of which has its problems:
            <br>
            <br>
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Document the pure system call in a Section 2 page, and then document
                the differences provided by the glibc wrapper in a corresponding 
                Section 3 page.
                The problem is that this would require userland programmers
                (the main audience of the pages)
                to look at two separate pages to get the information they require.
                <br>
                <br>
            </li>
            <li>
                Document the pure system call in a Section 2 page, and
                then document the complete behavior of the glibc wrapper
                in Section 3, repeating material from the
                Section 2 page as appropriate.
                The problem here is redundancy: any changes in the Section
                2 page would need to be carried through to the Section 3 page;
                inevitably, inconsistencies will arise.
                <blockquote>
                <em>Note:</em> I am doubtful that the problem noted in
                the above point could be resolved
                via some "include" mechanism that includes relevant
                pieces from the Section 2 page into the Section 3 page.
                I think that would make the man page source files more difficult
                to work with, and would likely be error-prone in practice
                (because the producers of the "include" mark-up (man2) would
                be separate from the consumers of that mark-up (man3)).
                </blockquote>
            </li>
        </ul>
        And of course it's worth noting that implementing either of
        the above approaches would be a significant piece of work.
        <br>
        <br>
        <li>
            Many pages in Section 3 and in Sections 5 and 7 relate
            purely to glibc.
            If those pages are not to be migrated into the kernel source tree
            (it makes little sense to do that), then
            they should be split out into a separate package.
            This raises several issues:
            <br>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Where should the "glibc" pages be hosted?
                    Apparently not with glibc, which favors <em>info</em>
                    pages (and it's worth noting that the <em>man-pages</em>
		    project often does a better job of documenting
		    the glibc interfaces).
                    <br>
                    <br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Splitting the manual pages into two separate packages is
                    a significant piece of work. It's not always obvious which
                    package a particular page would belong to. Many pages
                    contain content that would relate to both packages.
                    (Do we split those pages into separate pages in the
		    two packages?
                    That's a big task.)
                    <br>
                    <br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    From a maintenance point of view,
                    maintaining two separate (but at times quite closely related)
                    man page packages would be a little less comfortable
                    than a single unified package.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>

    </ul>

    <p>
        And there are some other points, which, while not exactly disadvantages,
        should be kept in mind when considering any change away from
        the approach currently employed in <em>man-pages</em>: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <em>man-pages</em> maintains historical information on interfaces.
            That is, each man page documents not just the the latest kernel
            (or glibc) implementation, but also changes in the interface over time.
            Such information is of course important for userland programmers.
            <br>
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>
            Sometimes, a man page relates to multiple underlying system calls.
            For example, there have over time been many system calls that
            correspond to the
            <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/stat.2.html">stat(2)</a>
            manual page.
            Other examples are the Section 2 pages for the sockets API and
            the System V IPC APIs;
            for both of those APIs, there are several Section 2 pages,
            but (on most architectures), only one multiplexed system call
            (respectively
            <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ipc.2.html">ipc(2)</a>
            and
            <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/socketcall.2.html">socketcall(2)</a>).
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Status:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            In my opinion, the disadvantages outweigh the advantages.
            Furthermore, making the necessary changes would entail significant
            time (which I don't have), and it's unproven whether the claimed
            benefits would be borne out in practice (the state of
            much of the material in the kernel
            <span class="pathname">Documentation</span> directory
            does not give grounds for optimism).
            But I'm open to hearing further ideas,
	    and don't discount the possibility of doing
	    something about this in the future.
            <br>
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>
            Here's an alternative idea.
            Employ a couple of patch tags in the style of
            "<span class="const">Signed-off-by:</span>".
            One of these could be (say)
            "<span class="const">ABI-changes-noted-by:</span>", indicating
            that someone has noted that this patch changes the API/ABI.
            The other would be (say)
            "<span class="const">ABI-changes-doc-acked-by:</span>",
            an indication from the appropriate documentation maintainer
            that the ABI changes have been documented in
            <em>man-pages</em> (or elsewhere if appropriate);
            details of the actual documentation could be included elsewhere
            in the patch's log message.
        </li>
    </ul>

<a name="new_markup"></a>
<h2>Design and adopt a new mark-up language (?)</h2>

    <p>
        Currently, the pages in <em>man-pages</em> are created with
	<em>groff</em>,
        using one of two macro packages:
        <em>man</em>, or the BSD derived <em>mdoc</em>.
        (The vast majority of pages in
        <em>man-pages</em>
        employ the <em>man</em> macro package.)
        Neither macro package is optimal, since they
        don't encode sufficient semantic detail about the elements of a page.
        (This is especially true of the <em>man</em> macro package.)
    </p>

    <p>
        What is perhaps required is a new mark-up language (probably some form
        of docbook) that:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            is unintrusive: the raw page source should remain very readable
        </li>
        <li>
            applies mark-up by function, not by effect
        </li>
        <li>
            can be easily processed to generate the present <em>nroff</em> from it
        </li>
        <li>
            can be easily processed to generate HTML from it
        </li>
        <li>
            is simple to learn and use
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        And of course, the existing pages would need to be converted to
        the new format.
    </p>

    <p>
        Status: too big a job to seriously entertain at the moment.
	(Since the kernel documentation's moce to Sphinx,
	that tool is the obvious choice to consider for this task.)
    </p>

<a name="style_guide"></a>
<h2>Devise or adopt a style guide</h2>

    <p>
        Because the pages in
        <em>man-pages</em>
        have been produced by many authors, there was much inconsistency
        in spelling, layout, terminology, and so on.
        During the course of the 2.xx and 3.xx releases there has been quite a lot
        of work done to achieve greater consistency
        (see for example the "Global changes" in releases

	and
        <a href="changelog.html#release_4.05">4.05</a>),
        but there is still more work to be done.
        To guide that work, as well as authors of future pages, 
        <em>man-pages</em> should have (i.e., probably adopt)
        a style guide.
    </p>

    <p>
        Status:
        The open question is: what existing style guide is suitable?
        (In the meantime,
        <span class=manpage><a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/man-pages.7.html">man-pages(7)</a></span>
        provides guidance on some points.)
