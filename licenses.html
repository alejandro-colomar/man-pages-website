<h1>Licenses for <em>man-pages</em></h1>

<p>
  All submissions to <em>man-pages</em> must be licensed using a
  license that permits the page to be freely redistributed and modified.
  Include that license or a reference to it,
  in the source code of the man page.
</p>

<p>
  There are many such licenses, but in the interests of minimizing
  the number of licenses in <em>man-pages</em>,
  it is preferred that you use one of the following:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="#verbatim">The "verbatim" license</a>
    (personal preference of the current maintainer, and seems also to have
    been the preference of the previous maintainer as well;
    also the most widely used license currently used in <em>man-pages</em>.)
    <br>
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <a href="#gpl">The GNU General Public License (GPL)</a>
    <br>
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <a href="#gpl">The BSD License</a>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  <em>man-pages</em> does not include pages under the
  <a href="https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html">GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL)</a>.
  This is a purely pragmatic decision, made because the
  <a href="https://www.debian.org/vote/2006/vote_001">GFDL is problematic for Debian</a>,
  one of the most widely used distributions.
</p>

<H2>The "Verbatim" License</H2>

<p>
  To use this license, just include the following at the top
  of the page source, and substitute the appropriate pieces:

<h2>The GNU General Public License (GPL)</h2>

<p>
  You can license under the GPL

  Licensing under GPLv2 is preferred, because so far only v2 of
